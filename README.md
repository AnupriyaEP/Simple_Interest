# Simple_Interest

C++ program for simple interest calculation.

Here, we include the necessary header file iostream for input/output operations and use the std namespace to avoid explicitly writing std before standard C++ library functions.
we decalare four variables time_period, rateodinterest, SimpleInterest and principle_amount.
The program prompts the user to input the principal_amount, rateofinterest, and time_period using cout (console output) and takes the user's input using cin (console input).
The simple interest is calculated using the formula (principal_amount * rateofinterest * time_period) / 100.
The program displays the calculated simple interest cout.
The main function returns an integer value (0) to indicate successful execution of the program to the operating system.
